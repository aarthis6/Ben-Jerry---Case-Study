# Ben-Jerry-Case-Study
In this case study of Ben & Jerry's, the company's journey from its inception by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield to its eventual acquisition by Unilever is explored through financial analysis and strategic evaluation.

The founders built Ben & Jerry's around a mission statement that emphasized product quality, economic development, and social responsibility. However, over the years, the company faced challenges in balancing these dimensions. While Ben & Jerry's excelled in social initiatives, its financial performance lagged, prompting considerations of mergers and acquisitions to improve shareholder value.

Financial valuation techniques like Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) were employed to estimate the fair value of Ben & Jerry's. The DCF analysis, considering future cash flows discounted at the WACC of 11.21%, yielded a per-share value of $60.51, indicating potential for strong returns.

The company became a takeover target due to its strong brand, loyal customer base, and manageable debt levels. Unilever's eventual acquisition offer of $36 per share was supported by its higher market capitalization and strategic fit, compared to other offers from Dreyer's Grand and Meadowbrook Lane. The DCF analysis validated Unilever's offer as justifiable based on projected cash flows and market comparables.

Despite employing various takeover defense strategies such as poison pills and forming unfriendly boards, Ben & Jerry's management ultimately accepted Unilever's offer. The decision was influenced by Unilever's promise to maintain Ben & Jerry's culture and operational autonomy, albeit under Unilever's umbrella.

As an independent director, defending the Unilever acquisition offer would have been prudent due to its financial soundness and strategic alignment. The acquisition provided immediate liquidity and growth opportunities while preserving Ben & Jerry's social mission under a global corporate steward.

In conclusion, while Ben & Jerry's employed robust defense strategies, the allure of Unilever's offer, supported by financial analysis and strategic fit, made it a compelling choice. The case underscores the challenges companies face in balancing financial performance with social responsibility and navigating acquisitions to maximize shareholder value.
